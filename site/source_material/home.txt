4coder is a code editor that lives in a space between an IDE and a power editor such as Emacs or Vim.  It targets maximum ease of customization, extension, and cross platform reliability.  Earlier versions of 4coder focused entirely on C/C++ but it is now transitioning to be a more general purpose editor. Here you can learn about the features of 4coder, how to get started with 4coder, and how to get the absolute most out of 4coder.
