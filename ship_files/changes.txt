4.1.8
 + On command line "-U <path>" sets the user directory
 + On command line "-L" "> log.txt" to get a startup log
 + The 4coder_fleury layer is now bundled with 4coder; run with '4ed -U 4coder_fleury'
 + New commands 'project_command_F1' ... 'project_command_F16' can be directly bound
   in key bindings.
 + In a project "fkey_command_override" can contain labeled sets ".name = { ... }"
   which override the fkey commands for a particular user;

 + Fix: crash when closing cli output buffer

4.1.6
 + In config.4coder "bind_by_physical_key" uses a key-layout that does not change with language

4.1.5
 + MAJOR: Scratch_Blocks now take arena pointer parameters in their constructor to specify arenas that should be treated as having distinct lifetimes, without doing this it is possible that a local scratch and another arena will actually refer to the same allocator and freeing the local scratch will also free memory that was meant to be in a separate arena.

 + 'clear_clipboard' command
 + in config.4coder the variable virtual_whitespace_regular_indent determines the number of space-widths to use as the regular indentation in a virtual whitespace layout
 + show whitespace mode implemented in 'default_render_buffer'
 + `set_face_size` and `set_face_size_this_buffer` commands
 + `HookID_WholeScreenRenderCaller` hook runs once per frame after all views render
 + Bindings use exact matches for modifiers, instead of most recent sub-set matches
 + Extended key codes list
 + Fix: tabs are measured with the correct amount of width for the user's settings
 + Fix: virtual whitespace toggling works when the config initially diabled virtual whitespace
 + Fix: never miss the most recent post to the clipboard on windows
 + Fix: command `load_theme_current_buffer` gaurds against destroying the active color palette when bad files are loaded
 + Fix: project deep copy routine copies strings in the whitelist and blacklist pattern arrays
 + Fix: footer panel manipulation functions check if the view exists

4.1.3
 + Unkillable buffer setting
 + UI elements in listers and buttons can have different highlight backgrounds
 + command 'load_theme_current_buffer' for loading the current file as a theme and setting it as the theme

 + Fix: line number background and text colors in the built in theme files
 + Fix: a drive letter by itself is recognized as an existing path
 + Fix: the margin colors for panels are determined by the margins in theme files
 + Fix: when a file is deleted outside of 4coder, the '!' dirty status is added to the buffer
 + Fix: on mac file changes outside of 4coder are detected and do not stall the UI
 + Fix: in virtual whitespace layouts blank lines correctly mark carriage return characters before newline characters
 + Fix: auto-indentation leaves the carriage return in CRLF line endings in place and does not count them as indentation
 + Fix: lexer emit pointer advances correctly when the output buffer becomes full
 + Fix: when include gaurds are inserted into new header files, the generated name isn't killed by numbers or underscores
 + Fix: base library function string_is_integer returns false on empty string
 + Fix: preprocessor directives after incomplete statements are aligned to zero by auto-indent
 + Fix: command 'list_all_functions_current_buffer_lister' and command 'list_all_functions_all_buffers_lister' are marked as UI commands and thus do not infinite loop when they set the buffer
 + Improvement: optimization in clean_all_lines command, handles CRLF line endings

4.1.2
 + Cursor color changes when recording macro if the theme provides a second cursor color
 + Default custom layer now has a feature for supporting fade ranges as used in pasting and undoing
 + Ability to "partially" paint text with a blend factor to create blends
 + In file lister, typing a slash with a name for a folder that does not exist asks the user if they would like to create a folder
