BUILDING 4coder_custom
-------------------------------------

To customize 4coder you have to build 4coder_custom.dll. The batch file buildsuper.bat will
compile the dll for you if you have visual studio installed. If you have an old version, use
the example to figure out how to get your old setup working in the new system.

As you create your customizations keep in mind that this API is still in development.
I will do what I can to keep your customizations working as I settle on an API, but some
updates may deeply break your code.

SOME DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------

NEW IN 4.0.9
================

I am deprecating this readme file now.  A much better documentation than what I used to
provide here is now provided in 4coder_API.html.  This is the last version that will
feature SUPERREADME.
